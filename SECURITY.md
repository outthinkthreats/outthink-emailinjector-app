# Reporting Security Issues

The OutThink team take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.
To report a security issue, please refer to our ["Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Program"](https://outthink.io/resource-center/trust-security/responsible-vulnerability-disclosure/) and follow the instructions there.

The OutThink team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
